This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Backstory

After creating project/startup landing pages and finding repeat elements each time such as pricing, FAQ, CTA forms and buttons, I made a simple template with to speed up the process for everyone.

## Features:

- Modern: built Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
- Responsive: works across all screen sizes.
- Extensible: customize the page and easily connect/build an app on it.
- Easy Deployment: easy to spin up and deploy to Vercel.
- Beauty: aesthetic and alive with animations.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
